#Jarvis: Building a remote console machine based on websocket.
##what Jarvis stands for?

The name Jarvis comes from the artificial intellegient assistive robot in the movie IronMan. Wouldn't it be nice to have an assistant who was programmed by you. So I name it to remind me that the purpose of this project and keep the enthusiasm of making it more functionional.

(Updated 2016.12.20) Today the founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg published a [blog](https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-jarvis/10154361492931634) revealing making a home AI project also named Jarvis. It's so interesting that how the movie affected us and make us start to do something. Though the scale of our projects is totally different, but I think the most important things is to keep the passion inspired by the spirit of "Jarvis".
